CLIMATE CHANGE 

In the past few years, it has become clear that the world is undergoing some terrible changes in the atmosphere. The reason for that is the 
excessive amount of CO2 that is polluting our planet. Countries all over the world are contributing to this terrible problem. This must be 
stopped and resolved in order to save the planet. Everyone must cooperate to and participate in reducing and hopefully completely stopping 
the usage of cars and other CO2 emitting machines.

In conclusion, by seeing the amount of CO2 emission globally both by countries and continents, I understand that we must really cease causing 
the level of pollution to rise in the atmosphere.
