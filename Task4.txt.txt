Atom is a great open source text editor developed by GitHub. This text editor in pretty efficient because you can make text files directly
within the app, because it you can direclty commit and push your changes from the app itself. On the other hand with you have to put all your 
files in the cloned respository and use the command line using commands like git commit -m "" and git push and set up your account etc. which
quite simple but still requires more steps. Although, I still prefer the command line, because I am just more used to it and it's simple for me.

For NetBeans, I discovered that you just you have to right click on the file you want to add and then all you just commit the changes the usual
way. I also discovered that you can directly use git on NetBeans.
